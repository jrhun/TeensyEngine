##Contributions

This project has been ongoing for years, I've taken bits and pieces of code that I've found useful or interesting and either used them as is, changed parts to fit, or re-written it completely. 
Unfortunately, much time has passed and I'm now I'm not entirely sure what parts are a complete rip off and what's original. 
If you see any of your code that I've used and not given credit for, please contact me so I can provide proper credit!
